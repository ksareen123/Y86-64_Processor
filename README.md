# Y86-64_Processor
This was a class project which helped myself and my partners better understand the intricacies of computer architecture, as we were tasked with designing, implementing, and debugging a simulated single-stage, 64 bit processor. To test this device and document its functionality, we developed a modular design and verified it with test code.
